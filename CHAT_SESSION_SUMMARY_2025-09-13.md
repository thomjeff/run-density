- **Report Generation**: ✅ All report types working
- **API Performance**: ✅ Response times within acceptable limits

### **Release Management**
- **Version Consistency**: ✅ Proper version incrementing
- **Asset Management**: ✅ All required files uploaded
- **Deployment Verification**: ✅ Cloud Run deployment successful

## 🔍 Key Technical Decisions

### **PDF Generation Approach**
- **Chosen**: Pandoc + LaTeX over WeasyPrint
- **Rationale**: Better Unicode support, professional output quality
- **Implementation**: BasicTeX for macOS compatibility

### **Code Hygiene Strategy**
- **Approach**: Phased implementation with risk mitigation
- **Priority**: Import management and logging standardization
- **Timeline**: 3-week implementation plan

### **Map Integration Strategy**
- **Backend**: New API endpoints for bin-level data
- **Frontend**: Enhanced Leaflet map with layer management
- **Data Structure**: GeoJSON for frontend integration

## 🚨 Challenges Overcome

### **LaTeX Installation Issues**
- **Problem**: MacTeX installation complications
- **Solution**: Switched to BasicTeX for better compatibility
- **Result**: Successful PDF generation with 160KB+ files

### **Unicode Emoji Handling**
- **Problem**: LaTeX doesn't handle Unicode emojis natively
- **Solution**: Implemented emoji cleaning function with replacements
- **Result**: Clean PDF output without Unicode errors

### **Version Management Confusion**
- **Problem**: Uncertainty about version incrementing strategy
- **Solution**: Confirmed current approach (every merge = new release)
- **Result**: Clear version management strategy

## 📋 Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Issue #160**: Investigate CI version consistency failures (follow-up to #150)
2. **Issue #146**: Implement map integration with ChatGPT guidance
3. **Issue #145**: Code hygiene implementation (after map UI work)

### **Strategic Priorities**
1. **Map Integration**: Begin bin-level visualization development with updated strategy
2. **Code Quality**: Implement comprehensive hygiene improvements (post-map work)
3. **CI Pipeline**: Resolve persistent version consistency issues
