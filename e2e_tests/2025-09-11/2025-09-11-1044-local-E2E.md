=== REPORT FILE TESTING ===

1. Temporal Flow MD files: ✅
2. Temporal Flow CSV files: ✅
3. Density Analysis MD files: ✅

Report File Testing: ✅ ALL PASSED

=== REPORT CONTENT QUALITY TESTING ===

1. Testing Temporal Flow Report Content...
   Proper event names (10K Range, Half Range): ✅
   No generic names (Event A Range): ✅
   No NaN values: ✅

2. Testing Density Analysis Report Content...
   Proper segment names (A1: Start to Queen/Regent): ✅
   No unknown segments: ✅
   Proper counts (Total Segments: 22): ✅ (Density analyzes physical course segments, while Flow analyzes runner pairs - hence different counts)

⚠️  Some tests failed - review before production deployment

📝 NOTE: Flow Runner detailed analysis is not included in automated tests due to computational requirements.
   Flow Runner reports can be run locally (not currently supported in production) using:
   curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/flow-audit' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"paceCsv": "data/runners.csv", "segmentsCsv": "data/segments.csv", "startTimes": {"Full": 420, "10K": 440, "Half": 460}}'

## Important Notes

📝 **Flow Runner Analysis**: Flow Runner detailed analysis is not included in automated tests due to computational requirements. Flow Runner reports can be run locally (not currently supported in production) using:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/flow-audit' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"paceCsv": "data/runners.csv", "segmentsCsv": "data/segments.csv", "startTimes": {"Full": 420, "10K": 440, "Half": 460}}'
```

## Conclusion

⚠️ Some tests failed. Please review the results before production deployment.
