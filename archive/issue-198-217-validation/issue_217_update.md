## 📋 ChatGPT Review Questions

The package is ready for ChatGPT's final validation with these key questions:

1. **Implementation Validation:** Does the bins_accumulator.py correctly solve the density=0.0 problem identified in Issue #198?

2. **Performance Assessment:** Is the 250ms generation time with 3,468 occupied bins acceptable for production deployment?

3. **Data Quality Review:** Are the density values (0.0-0.005 p/m²) and flow calculations realistic for the Fredericton Marathon scenario?

4. **Integration Completeness:** Is the integration into density_report.py complete and robust?

5. **Deployment Readiness:** Is the current implementation ready for production use with the feature flag approach?

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

**All success criteria from the original issue have been achieved:**
