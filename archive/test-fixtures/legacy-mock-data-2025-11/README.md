# Archived: Test Fixtures

**Archived Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Archived By:** AI Assistant (v1.7.1 architecture cleanup)  
**Original Location:** `/test_fixtures/`  
**Reason:** Unused legacy mock data with no active references

---

## Why This Was Archived

### Summary
The `/test_fixtures` directory contained small JSON mock data files that were never referenced by any active code, tests, or documentation. They appear to be leftover from early development or QA work.

### Archived Files

**3 Mock JSON Files** (422 bytes total)
- `flags.json` (120 bytes) - Mock flag/alert data
- `meta.json` (191 bytes) - Mock run metadata  
- `segment_metrics.json` (111 bytes) - Mock segment metrics

**Created:** Unknown (likely early development)  
**Last Modified:** October 23, 2025 (Issue #289 - QA fixes)  
**Status:** ❌ Not used anywhere in codebase

### Evidence of Non-Use

**No References Found:**
- ✅ `grep test_fixtures` → 0 matches across entire codebase
- ✅ Not imported by any Python files
- ✅ Not referenced in tests
- ✅ Not referenced in documentation
- ✅ Not copied in Dockerfile
- ✅ Not mounted in app/main.py

**Git History:**
- Last touched: Oct 23, 2025 (Issue #289)
- Created: Unknown (early development)
- Total commits: 2

      "type": "high_utilization"
    }

## What Replaced Them

**Real Test Data:**
- Actual test data comes from `/data` directory
- E2E tests use live API responses
- Tests use proper fixtures in `/tests` directory
- Mock data generated dynamically when needed

**Production Data:**
- Flags: Generated from actual analysis in GCS
- Metadata: Generated by `app/core/artifacts/frontend.py`
- Segment metrics: Computed from real density analysis

---

## Restoration Instructions

**Note:** These files were unused and restoration is not recommended.

If you need mock data for testing:
```bash
# Use proper test fixtures
# See: tests/ directory for current test patterns

# Or use real data
# See: data/ directory for actual segments, runners, etc.
```

## Related Context

- **Issue #289:** QA Round 1 Fixes (last time these files were touched)
- **Current Testing:** Uses real data from `/data` and live E2E responses
- **Mock Data:** Generated dynamically in tests when needed

## Verification Checklist

Before archival was completed:

- ✅ No references in codebase
- ✅ No imports in Python files
- ✅ Not used by tests
- ✅ Not referenced in documentation
- ✅ Not in Dockerfile
- ✅ Functionality replaced by real/dynamic data
