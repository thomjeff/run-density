# Issue #233 Validation Package - Canonical Segments Foundation

## üìä **VALIDATION SUMMARY**

**Date**: September 19, 2025  
**Purpose**: Provide validation evidence for Issue #233 operational intelligence foundation  
**Source**: Issue #231 completion with ChatGPT's reconciliation v2 script  

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION RESULTS: PERFECT**

### **Reconciliation v2 Script Results:**
```
=== CANONICAL RECONCILIATION (bins -> fresh vs saved) ===
Rows compared:      1760
Mean |rel err|:     0.000000
P95  |rel err|:     0.000000  (tolerance 0.0200)
Max  |rel err|:     0.000000
Windows > 0.0200:   0

RESULT: PASS ‚úÖ
```

### **Data Quality Metrics:**
- **Total Time Windows**: 1,760 (80 windows √ó 22 segments)
- **Reconciliation Error**: 0.000000% (perfect)
- **Segments Validated**: 22 (all segments)
- **Methodology**: bottom_up_aggregation (verified)

## üìÅ **FILES INCLUDED**

### **1. reconciliation_canonical_vs_fresh.csv**
- **Purpose**: Per-window comparison between canonical segments and fresh bins aggregation
- **Columns**: segment_id, t_start, t_end, density_mean, density_mean_fresh, density_peak_fresh, abs_rel_err
- **Result**: Perfect 0.000000% error across all 1,760 windows

### **2. segment_windows_from_bins.parquet**
- **Purpose**: Canonical segments derived from bins (source of truth)
- **Structure**: 1,760 rows with segment_id, t_start, t_end, density_mean, density_peak, n_bins
- **Quality**: Validated against bins with perfect reconciliation

### **3. segments_legacy_vs_canonical.csv**
- **Purpose**: Transition visibility comparing legacy vs canonical methodologies
- **Use**: Historical reference and methodology comparison
- **Status**: Canonical segments now promoted to source of truth
