## Recommended Work Order

### **Morning (High Priority)**
1. Close completed issues (#123, #126, #124)
2. Complete Issue #115 (E2E testing enhancements)
3. Investigate Issue #122 (Flow calculation anomalies)

### **Afternoon (Medium Priority)**
4. Work on Issue #100 (Metadata fields)
5. Investigate Issue #113 (Missing runner IDs)
6. Review CI workflow failures

### **Evening (Investigation)**
7. Investigate Issue #131 (Density enhancements)
8. Create CI workflow failure issue
9. Plan documentation work for next day

## Key Considerations

### **Workflow Discipline**
- Always create dev branch for each issue
- Follow 9-step merge/test process
- Never make changes directly to main
- Test frequently and commit incrementally

### **Technical Debt**
- Address CI workflow failures to ensure reliable deployments
- Complete E2E testing enhancements for better test coverage
- Fix data accuracy issues in flow calculations

### **User Experience**
- Focus on report usability improvements
- Complete documentation for better user understanding
- Ensure data completeness and accuracy

## Success Metrics
- All high-priority issues completed
- CI workflow running green consistently
- No workflow violations
- All changes properly tested and documented
