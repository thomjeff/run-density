- **Investigation**: Review current report format and identify readability improvements
- **Expected Outcome**: More user-friendly reports for race directors and marshals
- **Dependencies**: Issue #131 (COMPLETED) - no longer blocking

### **🔍 VERIFICATION TASKS**

#### **9. Issue #72 Verification** 🔍
- **Objective**: Verify if Issue #72 can be closed
- **Action**: Review current API capabilities and determine if requirements are met
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear decision on closure or implementation needed

#### **10. Issue #89 Verification** 🔍
- **Objective**: Verify if Issue #89 can be closed
- **Action**: Review flow_type classification enhancements and determine completion status
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear decision on closure or implementation needed

## 🚀 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Critical Issues (Morning)**
1. Complete 9-step merge process
2. Investigate Issue #143 (Cloud Run caching)
3. Implement fix for Issue #143

### **Phase 2: High Priority Issues (Afternoon)**
1. Review and implement Issue #72 (Flow API seg_id)
2. Review and implement Issue #92 (Runner Experience)
3. Review and implement Issue #105 (Flow↔Density Integration)

### **Phase 3: Verification and Preparation (Evening)**
1. Verify Issues #72 and #89 closure status
2. Review Issues #146, #145, #147 for preparation
3. Plan next day's work based on progress

## 📁 **File Structure for Tomorrow**

### **New Dev Branches to Create**
- `dev/issue-143-cloud-run-caching` - For Issue #143 investigation
- `dev/issue-72-flow-api-segid` - For Issue #72 implementation
- `dev/issue-92-runner-experience` - For Issue #92 implementation
- `dev/issue-105-flow-density-integration` - For Issue #105 implementation

### **Investigation Files to Review**
- Cloud Run deployment configuration
- E2E test file generation logic
- Report file detection mechanisms
- CI/CD pipeline report handling

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **For Each Issue**
1. Create dev branch following Pre-task safeguards
2. Run E2E tests on dev branch before changes
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Run E2E tests after each change
5. Follow 9-step merge process

### **Special Considerations**
- **Issue #143**: Focus on Cloud Run testing and caching behavior
- **Issue #72**: Test API endpoint changes thoroughly
- **Issue #92**: Validate runner experience metrics
- **Issue #105**: Test integration between Flow and Density modules

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Daily Goals**
- Complete 9-step merge process
- Resolve Issue #143 (critical)
- Implement at least 2 high-priority issues
- Verify 2 issues for closure

### **Quality Metrics**
- All E2E tests passing
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Clean code with proper documentation
- Comprehensive testing coverage

## 🔄 **Rollback Plans**

### **For Each Issue**
- Keep clean commits for easy rollback
- Test rollback procedures
- Document rollback steps
- Maintain working main branch

### **Emergency Procedures**
- If critical issues arise, revert to last known good state
- Prioritize system stability over feature completion
- Communicate issues immediately

## 📝 **Notes and Considerations**

### **From Today's Session**
- Issue #131 v2 rulebook implementation was complex but successful
- Version detection bugs can cause silent failures
- E2E tests are critical for validation
- Proper error handling prevents debugging issues

### **For Tomorrow**
- Start with Issue #143 investigation (critical)
- Use systematic approach for each issue
- Maintain clean git history
- Follow Pre-task safeguards religiously
