# M1c Segment Validation Report

**Date:** January 2, 2025  
**Segment:** M1c - Station Rd. to Trail/Aberdeen  
**Flow Type:** overtake  
**Events:** Half vs Full  

## Executive Summary

M1c represents a significant interaction zone where fast Half marathon runners (finishing their race at 19.2-20.85km) encounter slower Full marathon runners (at 18.65-20.3km) over an extended 52.4-minute temporal window. The segment shows significant interaction rates requiring substantial race organizer attention.

## Segment Configuration

- **Range Half:** 19.2km to 20.85km (1.65km segment)

- **Total Half:** 912 runners
- **Total Full:** 368 runners
- **Convergence Point:** 19.2km (at segment start)
- **Conflict Zone:** 19.2km to 19.25km (100m around convergence point)

## Results Summary

### Interaction Rates
- **Overtaking Half:** 265/912 (29.1%) - **Significant**
- **Overtaking Full:** 88/368 (23.9%) - **Significant**
- **Total Interactions:** 353 overtakes

### Classification
- **Half:** 29.1% (Significant) - requires race organizer attention
- **Full:** 23.9% (Significant) - requires race organizer attention

## Detailed Analysis

### Temporal Flow Analysis
- **Overlap Start:** 08:48:37
- **Overlap End:** 09:41:02
- **Overlap Duration:** 52.4 minutes
- **Extended interaction window** allows for high participation rates

### Runner Characteristics
**Half Marathon Runners Involved:**
- **Pace range:** 3.58 to 6.23 min/km
- **Average pace:** 5.10 min/km (fast runners)
- **Start offset range:** 0s to 124s
- **Average start offset:** 34.9s

**Full Marathon Runners Involved:**
- **Pace range:** 5.78 to 8.52 min/km
- **Average pace:** 6.92 min/km (moderate to slow runners)
- **Start offset range:** 0s to 124s
- **Average start offset:** 74.3s

### Conflict Zone Analysis
- **Half conflict zone:** 0.100km at 5.10 min/km = 1.2 seconds
- **Full conflict zone:** 0.050km at 6.92 min/km = 0.4 seconds
- **Minimum overlap duration required:** 5.0 seconds

### Sample Runners
- **Sample Half runners:** 2048, 2049, 2050, 2051, 2052
- **Sample Full runners:** 2768, 2780, 2781, 2796, 2797

## Key Insights

### 1. Significant Interaction Rates
- **High Half involvement:** 29.1% of Half runners
- **High Full involvement:** 23.9% of Full runners
- **Both events show Significant levels** requiring race organizer attention

### 2. Extended Overlap Window
- **52.4 minutes** of temporal convergence
- **Longer than M1b** (45.5 minutes) and much longer than M1a (10.0 minutes)
- **Sustained interaction period** allows for high participation rates

### 3. Pace Differential Pattern
- **Fast Half runners:** 5.10 min/km average pace
- **Slower Full runners:** 6.92 min/km average pace
- **Pace ratio:** 1.4x difference (Half runners faster than Full)
- **Opposite pattern from M1b** where Full runners were faster

### 4. Start Offset Patterns
- **Both events have moderate start offsets** (34.9s Half, 74.3s Full)
- **Similar offset ranges** (0-124s for both events)
- **Offset differences** contribute to the extended overlap window

## Algorithm Validation

### Convergence Point Calculation
- **Convergence at segment start:** 19.2km
- **Algorithm correctly identifies** where Half and Full runners meet
- **No theoretical intersection points** - only actual temporal overlaps reported

### Overlap Detection
- **Precise temporal overlap detection** within 100m conflict zone
- **5-second minimum overlap duration** filters out brief encounters
- **Individual runner timing** accounts for start offsets and pace variations

### Data Integrity
- **Start offset impact confirmed:** Moderate offsets (34.9s Half, 74.3s Full) contribute to timing
- **Pace distribution validated:** Fast Half runners (5.10 min/km) vs slower Full runners (6.92 min/km)
- **Conflict zone duration:** Very short individual durations (0.4-1.2 seconds) but sustained overlap window

## Race Organizer Implications

### High Priority Segment
- **Significant interaction rates** (29.1% Half, 23.9% Full)
- **Extended overlap window** (52.4 minutes)
- **Sustained runner density** throughout the segment

### Operational Considerations
- **Crowd management** required for 52.4-minute period
- **Course marshaling** needed at convergence point (19.2km)
- **Safety protocols** for high interaction rates
- **Communication systems** for extended overlap period

### Comparison with Other M Segments
- **M1a:** Minimal interactions (10.0 minutes overlap)
- **M1b:** Moderate interactions (45.5 minutes overlap)
- **M1c:** Significant interactions (52.4 minutes overlap)
- **Progressive increase** in interaction complexity

## Validation Status

**âœ… PASSED** - Algorithm correctly identifies significant interaction zone with extended temporal overlap window and high participation rates from both events.

**Next Phase:** Continue with additional segment testing (M1d, M2a, M2b, M2c, M2d group)
