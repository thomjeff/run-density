- **Half runners:** Start offset range 0s to 124s, Average 93.4s (significant delays)

## Technical Insights

### 1. Convergence Point Dynamics
**Finding:** The convergence point represents a critical junction in the race course.

**Analysis:**
- **Convergence at 37.12km:** Start of L1 segment
- **Full runners:** Returning from Full Turn via segment J2
- **Half runners:** Returning from Half Turn
- **Shared path:** Both events now on the same geographic trail (segment K2)

**Insight:** The convergence point is not arbitrary but represents the specific junction where two different event flows merge onto the same return path.

### 2. Bidirectional Overtaking Patterns
**Finding:** Significant overtaking activity in both directions on shared trail.

**Pattern Analysis:**
- **Fast Full vs Slow Half:** Full runners (4.68 min/km) significantly faster than Half runners (7.69 min/km)
- **Bidirectional flow:** Both events on return journeys with different pace characteristics
- **Shared trail width:** 3.0m wide trail accommodating bidirectional flow

**Insight:** The pace differential creates natural overtaking opportunities on the shared return path.

### 3. Temporal Window Characteristics
**Finding:** Extended temporal overlap window creates sustained interaction period.

**Timing Analysis:**
- **142.7-minute overlap:** Sustained interaction period
- **Full runners enter later:** Starting at 09:26 vs Half at 08:37
- **Half runners exit later:** Until 11:48 vs Full until 12:18

**Insight:** The extended overlap window provides multiple opportunities for overtaking interactions.

### 4. Start Offset Impact
**Finding:** Start offsets significantly affect interaction patterns.

**Offset Analysis:**
- **Full runners:** Minimal start offsets (12.3s average)
- **Half runners:** Significant start offsets (93.4s average)
- **Impact:** Start offsets extend the temporal overlap window

**Insight:** Start offset variations create additional complexity in the interaction patterns.

## Race Organizer Implications

### 1. Major Overtaking Zone Management
- **High interaction rates** require significant course management attention
- **Bidirectional flow** on 3.0m trail needs careful monitoring
- **Extended temporal window** (2.4 hours) requires sustained management

### 2. Course Design Insights
- **Shared return path** creates natural overtaking opportunities
- **Pace differential** between events drives interaction rates
- **Trail width** (3.0m) accommodates bidirectional flow but may create congestion

### 3. Runner Safety Considerations
- **Fast Full runners** overtaking slower Half runners
- **Bidirectional flow** requires clear course markings and runner education
- **Extended interaction period** requires sustained volunteer presence

### 4. Operational Planning
- **142.7-minute window** requires extended volunteer coverage
- **High runner involvement** (30.2% Full, 16.0% Half) indicates significant impact
- **Shared trail management** needs coordination between event organizers

## Recommendations

### 1. Algorithm Validation
- âœ… **Continue current analysis approach** - provides accurate overtaking detection
- âœ… **Maintain bidirectional flow analysis** - captures complex interaction patterns
- âœ… **Preserve temporal window analysis** - essential for operational planning

### 2. Course Management
- **L1 segment:** Requires significant attention due to high interaction rates
- **Bidirectional flow:** Implement clear course markings and runner education
- **Extended window:** Provide sustained volunteer coverage for 2.4-hour period

### 3. Race Planning
- **Monitor pace differentials** between events on shared paths
- **Plan for extended interaction periods** on bidirectional segments
- **Coordinate event timing** to manage interaction windows

## Conclusion
