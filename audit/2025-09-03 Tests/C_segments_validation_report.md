- **Tolerance for Convergence Detection:** 5 seconds

## Key Findings

### 1. C1 Analysis: Successful Bidirectional Flow Detection

**Segment Details:**
- **Events:** 10K vs Full Marathon
- **Range A (10K):** 4.25km to 5.8km (return from 10K Turn)
- **Range B (Full):** 14.8km to 16.35km (outbound to 10K Turn area)
- **Flow Type:** overtake
- **Overtake Flag:** y
- **Direction:** bidirectional

**Results:**
- ✅ **Convergence Point:** 4.25km (start of segment)
- ✅ **Total Interactions:** 131 overtakes (54 10K, 77 Full)
- ✅ **Percentage Overtake:** 8.7% 10K (Notable), 20.9% Full (Significant)

**Key Runners Involved:**
- **10K Runners:** 54 slow runners (average pace 10.01 min/km, 65.5s start offset)
- **Full Runners:** 77 fast runners (average pace 4.47 min/km, 8.6s start offset)

**Timing Analysis:**
- **10K Arrival Window:** 07:58:02 to 08:13:16 (returning from 10K Turn)
- **Full Arrival Window:** 07:58:13 to 08:12:10 (outbound to 10K Turn area)
- **Overlap Duration:** ~15 minutes of temporal convergence

### 2. C2 Analysis: Proper Filtering of Non-Overtake Segments

**Segment Details:**
- **Events:** 10K vs Full Marathon
- **Range A (10K):** 4.25km to 5.8km (outbound to 10K Turn)
- **Range B (Full):** 2.7km to 4.25km (return from 10K Turn area)
- **Flow Type:** (empty)
- **Overtake Flag:** n
- **Direction:** bidirectional

**Algorithm Behavior:**
- ❌ **Filtered Out:** Not included in standard analysis results
- ✅ **Correct Filtering:** Algorithm properly excludes segments flagged for density analysis only

**Why Filtering is Correct:**
- C2 represents 10K fast vs Full slow scenario
- Flagged as density analysis, not overtake analysis
- Algorithm intelligently focuses on meaningful overtake scenarios

## Technical Insights

### 1. Bidirectional Flow Analysis Success
**Finding:** The algorithm successfully handles complex bidirectional flow scenarios where runners from different events are moving in opposite directions.

**Geographic Convergence:**
- 10K at 4.25km (returning) meets Full at 14.8km (outbound)
- Same geographic point, different event distances
- Algorithm correctly identifies temporal overlaps at geographic convergence

**Recommendation:** Continue supporting bidirectional flow analysis for complex race scenarios.

### 2. Convergence Point Interpretation Enhancement
**Finding:** Current convergence point reporting can be confusing for complex segments.

**Current Format:** "Convergence Point: 4.25km"
**Proposed Format:** "Segment Converge Point: 0.0km (4.25km 10K, 14.8km Full)"

**Benefits:**
- Shows position within segment (0.0km = start)
- Shows actual distance each event has run
- Clarifies geographic convergence for different event distances
- Improves human readability for race planning

### 3. Start Offset Impact in Bidirectional Scenarios
**Finding:** Start offsets continue to be critical in bidirectional flow analysis.

**C1 Case Study:**
- 10K runners: 65.5s average start offset
- Full runners: 8.6s average start offset
- Start offsets create temporal convergence window

**Validation:** Start offsets are essential for accurate bidirectional flow analysis.

### 4. Algorithm Precision in Complex Scenarios
**Finding:** The algorithm maintains precision in complex geographic and temporal scenarios.

**C1 Validation:**
- 131 total interactions identified
- Detailed runner-by-runner analysis confirms accuracy
- Temporal overlap detection works correctly in bidirectional flow

**Recommendation:** Trust algorithm precision in complex race scenarios.

## Race Organizer Implications

### 1. Bidirectional Flow Management
- Complex race courses with bidirectional segments require careful planning
- Geographic convergence points can create significant interaction zones
- Start time management is critical for minimizing bidirectional conflicts

### 2. Convergence Point Interpretation
