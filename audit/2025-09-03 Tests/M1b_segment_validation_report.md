**Finding:** Significant growth in interaction rates from F2 to M1b.

**Growth Analysis:**
- **10K involvement:** 17.8% (F2) â†’ 30.3% (M1b) = +12.5 percentage points
- **Full involvement:** 34.2% (F2) â†’ 54.6% (M1b) = +20.4 percentage points
- **Both events show substantial growth** in continuation segment

**Insight:** The continuation segment captures additional runners and extends interaction opportunities.

### 3. Extended Temporal Window
**Finding:** Longer overlap window in M1b compared to F2.

**Timing Analysis:**
- **45.5-minute overlap** in M1b

## Race Organizer Implications

### 1. High-Priority Segment Management
- **Significant interaction rates** require substantial course management attention

- **Coordinated management** needed across consecutive segments
- **Extended volunteer coverage** required for interaction corridor

### 3. Runner Safety Considerations
- **High interaction rates** (30.3% 10K, 54.6% Full) require careful monitoring

## Conclusion

The M1b segment validation successfully confirmed this is a significant interaction corridor requiring race organizer attention. Key insights include:

1. **Significant Interaction Corridor:** 30.3% 10K and 54.6% Full involvement represents substantial overtaking activity
2. **Continuation Pattern:** Strong overlap with F2 segment (50.8% 10K, 47.8% Full)
3. **Extended Temporal Window:** 45.5-minute overlap period requires sustained management
4. **Interaction Rate Growth:** Substantial increase from F2 to M1b (+12.5% 10K, +20.4% Full)

The algorithm is performing exactly as designed, providing precise analysis of this significant interaction corridor. This validation confirms the system's ability to handle continuation segments and provides actionable insights for race organizers.

**M1b represents a significant continuation and expansion of the F2 interaction zone where 10K and Full runners continue their shared path from Station Rd. to Trail/Aberdeen. The segment shows substantial growth in interaction rates (17.8%â†’30.3% for 10K, 34.2%â†’54.6% for Full) with approximately half of the M1b participants also having been involved in F2. The continuation pattern creates an extended interaction corridor where runners who began overtaking in F2 continue their interactions in M1b, while additional runners join the interaction zone due to the longer temporal window and different timing characteristics.**

**This represents a significant interaction corridor requiring sustained race organizer attention throughout the Station Rd. to Trail/Aberdeen segment!** ðŸš¨
