## Excel Calculations
- There is no overlap at the Convergence Points provided in the result set for A1a or A1b.
- There is a CP for A1c.
seg_id  distance  Half_fast   10K_slow    Overtake
A1a     0.45      7:41:37 AM  7:25:26 AM  FALSE
A1b     1.35      7:44:50 AM  7:36:19 AM  FALSE
A1c     2.36      7:48:27 AM  7:48:31 AM  TRUE

- To confirm A1a and A1b should never have a CP, I changed distance to = to_km (max) for each segment:

A1a     0.90      7:43:13 AM  7:30:53 AM  FALSE

## Excel Calculations
- There is no overlap at the Convergence Points provided in the result set for A2a, A2b or A2c.
- You are correct in the Count A and B = 0, but why report a CP?
- Interesting the same CP (0.45 and 1.35) from A1a and A1b are appearing here.
- Are you using median or calculating 'expect overlaps' again?
