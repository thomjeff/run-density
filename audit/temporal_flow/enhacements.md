### ChatGPT thoughts on temporal flow
2025-09-03

Morning, we made some progress last night on the overtake.py logic. The results for F1 (f1_validation_report) were shocking, as they showed Overtaking 10K: 601 runners (97.2% of 618 total) and Overtaking Half: 912 runners (100% of 912 total). Clearly, a further analysis is required to understand these statistics and question whether these are the proper statistical measures. 

So I asked about a statistical function that would show a gradual buildup, and Cursor came back with a temporal flow. You can see the insights and report from that initial work. 

It reminded me of the work we did to show the progression of the build-up of what we were then calling congestion. You created a nice graph and provided a table of that work. A copy of the graph and table is attached. See 10K_Half_000_274km.csv and sample_chart.jpg in /audit/temporal_flow.

1. Assume a basic understanding of statistics, and explain temporal flow insights.
2. Is this the right statistical measure and calculation? You can review the temporal_flow.py logic.
3. If the right measure, would incorporating the chart and graph you created a couple of weeks ago add value in understanding the flow? I like the graph as it is easy for the Organizing Committee to understand.
4. If not the right measure, or not the best measure on its own, what would you suggest? Only need a suggestion, not a detailed code, as this takes you time to prepare, and we're only at a 'thinking stage'
5. I'm thinking this measure works when combined with crowd density -- this is a separate density.py that will be calculated. 

I'm also thinking that *overtake* describes well what is happening in A* segments as these are from the start (km=0.0km), but F* are more of a *merge* where the Half (having run 2.7km from the start point of 0.0km) meet 10K (5.81km run) and Full runners (16.34km run). M1a and M1b are also merge scenario where late 10K (8.1km) merging with Half (18.59km) and Full (40.57km) runners.

Do you feel the term overtake is too restrictive for all segments? Should there be an additional column added to describe the segment (overtake vs. merge)? I'm not sure the algorithm would be different, it is more about interpreting the results where the true overtakes (like A*) will have lower counts than cases where two fields are merging, particularily F1 where a Half (n=912) are so early in their race and merging in with two other fields, 10K (many) and Full (not as many).

Any other suggestions on further refining and making this analysis more impactful for race organizers on the committee? I'm accepting the overtake.py functionality is correct and it simply needs more context and easier to understand reporting, graphing, etc.

Response:
Great work pushing this forward—what you’ve got is very close to the thing the Committee will intuitively “get.” I’ll tackle your questions in order and keep it practical for decision-making.

1) Temporal flow — what the insights mean (plain English)
* What it measures: how many runners from each event are inside the same convergence sub-segment at the same moment, sliced into short time bins (e.g., 30s). Think of it as a moving headcount in the zone.
* Why it’s useful: it shows the build-up → peak → taper pattern, telling you when staffing, cones, bike escorts, and signage are most needed.
* What F1 shows: a ~75-minute active window with a sharp joint peak around ~484–486 min after the day’s zero-point, where concurrent counts are highest (10K peaks ~234, Half peaks ~451; overlap peaks ~234). That matches the “shocking” 97–100% overtaking/merging you saw: the two fields are in the zone together for a long time, so nearly everyone “qualifies” as overlapping at some point.    

2) Is the current measure & calculation “right”? (quick code review)

Strengths
* Uses per-runner entry/exit times to compute concurrent occupancy per bin—good for staffing and risk windows.
* Produces clear peaks and totals plus a simple distribution summary—good for comms.  

Gaps worth tightening
* Zone definition is very long. _calculate_detailed_temporal_flow measures from the convergence point to the end of the segment (s_end=1.0). That inflates occupancy and overlap minutes—especially on F1—driving the near-100% rates. Consider narrowing to the actual conflict length (e.g., 100–300 m of shared path) rather than “cp → segment end.”  
* “Overlap” = min(counts_a, counts_b). That’s a cap on possible pairings, not a true pass/merge rate. It’s fine as a proxy for “both present,” but don’t interpret it as “overtakes per bin.”
* Hard-coded flow-rate divisor. flow_rate divides by 30 seconds even if time_bin_seconds changes. Replace with time_bin_seconds so the units are correct.
* min_overlap_duration is unused. If you want to avoid “brush-by” artifacts, apply this when counting a runner as overlapping (e.g., require ≥15–30 s simultaneity in-zone).
* Bin timestamping. Peak “time” is reported as the left edge of the bin. Consider storing/plotting bin centers for readability.
* Efficiency (optional): You can replace the nested loop with an “events” method (enter=+1, exit=−1, cumulative sum) for O(n log n).

Bottom line: the temporal-occupancy idea is right; the zone length and overlap proxy are what make the F1 percentages look extreme.

3) Should we include your earlier distance-progression chart & table?

Yes. The “per-step congestion vs distance” graph you shared is a perfect companion view:
* Temporal flow answers “when”.
* Distance progression answers “where” within the segment.

Together they tell the Committee: “At ~484–486 min we expect the peak, and the buildup starts around ~2.6–2.7 km along the Half ruler / ~6.9–7.1 km on the 10K ruler.” That pairing makes deployment decisions obvious.

4) If temporal flow isn’t sufficient on its own, what else?

Keep temporal flow, but add one or two of these lightweight measures:
* Density (runners/m or runners/m²). Convert occupancy to density using the effective conflict length and width. Then classify with simple LOS bands (e.g., “Comfortable < 1.0/m², Busy 1.0–1.8, Constrained > 1.8”). This translates directly to marshalling actions.
* Time-over-threshold (TOT). Minutes above density X (e.g., 1.2/m²) or occupancy Y (e.g., 120 concurrent). This produces a single, memorable risk number for each segment.
* Peak 5-min rolling average. Smooths spikiness and matches how operations experience load.
* Headway profile. Estimate distribution of inter-runner time gaps; the share of gaps < 1.0–1.5 s is a proxy for weaving/contacts risk.
* Cumulative arrival curves (N-curves). Plot cumulative entries/exits for each field in the conflict length; the vertical gap = number “in system,” the slope = flow. This is intuitive and audit-friendly.

5) Combining with crowd density (your idea)

Fully agree. Temporal flow → concurrent count; density.py → count ÷ (length × width). Report both and add TOT. That gives planners the “when,” “how many,” and “how tight,” which is exactly what they need to decide barriers, signage, cones, and bike sweeps.

On terminology: “overtake” vs “merge”

You’re right: A* segments are true overtake scenarios (same field compressing/stratifying), while F* and M1a/M1b are merge scenarios (different fields joining). I’d add a column to segments.csv:
* interaction_type ∈ {overtake, merge, diverge}
* (Optional) conflict_length_m and effective_width_m

The core calculation can stay the same, but the labels, charts, and thresholds should be phrased differently (e.g., “merge load” rather than “overtakes”). This will also help explain why F1 has very high “overlap” counts even early in the Half—because it’s a merge with a long shared path.  

Concrete tweaks that will make the outputs land with the Committee
* Shorten the analyzed conflict length (e.g., 150–300 m around the true pinch) and re-run—your “% overlapping” will drop to something more believable and more operationally useful.  
* Report trio per segment:
1.	Peak concurrent (and time window),
2.	Peak density (and LOS band),
3.	TOT above threshold (minutes).

* Pair plots on one page: (a) Temporal flow (time on x-axis; stacked/overlaid 10K/Half; mark peak), (b) Distance progression (your earlier chart). Add a one-line takeaway under each.
* Use language by interaction type: “merge window,” “merge peak,” “merge density,” etc.
* Flag staffing triggers: e.g., “If density >1.4/m² for >12 min, deploy two extra Course Marshals to F1; if >1.8/m², hold 10K late-wave for 60s.”

Quick references to your current outputs
* Peak times & counts and distribution summaries for F1 (temporal flow).  
* Validation report showing 97.2% (10K) and 100% (Half) “overtaking,” long zone, and ~49-min overlap window—root cause of the inflated percentages.  
* Your short “insights” memo distilling why the 100% reading appears—broader Half distribution and sustained flow.  

⸻

TL;DR
* Keep temporal flow—it’s the right backbone.
* Tighten the conflict length, fix minor calc bugs, and rename F segments to “merge.”*
* Add density + time-over-threshold and pair with your distance-progression chart.

That combination will be accurate, intuitive, and immediately actionable for the Organizing Committee.


I asked ChatGPT how it created the charts, and its reply, 

Here’s how I created the earlier flow chart and table you’re remembering — this should give Cursor a head start in replicating or improving it:
1.	Tools Used
* I used Python with pandas and matplotlib.
* pandas handled the time-binned runner counts (very similar to what your temporal_flow.py now does).
* matplotlib generated the chart (line plot and area fill to show buildup).
* For the table, I exported the aggregated statistics (peak time, mean flow, totals) into a simple pandas DataFrame, which was then formatted and either printed to console, exported as CSV, or displayed in Markdown.

2.	Process
* Bin the times: Runner entry/exit times through a convergence or merge point were grouped into fixed-size bins (30s or 60s).
* Count overlaps: For each bin, I counted how many runners were present.
* Generate cumulative curve: I also produced a cumulative distribution (running total of runners over time) to highlight the buildup effect — this is what makes the chart intuitive.
* Visualize:
	* Line plot for each group (e.g., 10K, Half, Full) plus an “overlap” line.
	* Cumulative shaded area chart for congestion buildup.
* Summarize: Alongside the chart, I produced a summary table with:
	* Total runners per field
	* Peak flow (count and time)
	* Mean and standard deviation
	* Duration of peak period

3.	Why it worked for the Organizing Committee
* The graph showed a gradual rise and fall, which felt intuitive (rather than just stating “97% overtaking”).
* The table gave a quick reference for decision-making (e.g., when to staff water stations, when congestion was highest).
* Combined, it turned the statistics into a narrative of how the field moved and merged, rather than a single static percentage.

⸻

For Cursor:
If you adapt temporal_flow.py, you already have the time-binned counts (flow_data).
* Add a cumulative runner count (np.cumsum(counts)).
* Plot both instantaneous flow (per bin) and cumulative flow on the same figure.
* Generate a summary DataFrame from flow_analysis and save it as CSV or a Markdown analysis report.
