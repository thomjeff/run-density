## **üìã Task 1: Issue #172 - Cloud Run Worker Timeout**

**Status**: New issue - critical production problem  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks core functionality on Cloud Run  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### **Problem Summary**:
- Force-refresh endpoint causes worker timeouts because density analysis exceeds Cloud Run's 60-second limit
- "Generate New Analysis" button doesn't work on Cloud Run deployment
- Causes unnecessary billing charges from failed analysis attempts and worker restarts
- Maps show only basic geometry without density/flow data

### **Actions**:
1. **Investigate timeout root cause**
   - Analyze density analysis performance bottlenecks
   - Identify which parts of analysis take longest
   - Check for inefficient algorithms or data processing

2. **Implement solution** (choose one):
   - **Option A**: Optimize analysis to complete within 60s
   - **Option B**: Add proper timeout handling to fail fast
   - **Option C**: Disable force-refresh on Cloud Run temporarily
   - **Option D**: Implement asynchronous processing

3. **Test solution**
   - Verify analysis completes within timeout limits
   - Test force-refresh endpoint works correctly
   - Ensure no worker timeouts or restarts

4. **Monitor and validate**
   - Check Cloud Run logs for stability
   - Verify billing impact is minimized
   - Test maps functionality with real data

### **Success Criteria**:
- Force-refresh endpoint works without worker timeouts
- "Generate New Analysis" button functions on Cloud Run
- No unnecessary billing charges from failed attempts
- Maps display complete density/flow data
- Issue #172 closed with resolution documented
