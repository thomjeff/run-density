# A2/A3 Results
2025-09-08 13:20

*Me to ChatGPT:* 
Looking at the results for A2 Half vs 10K → 34/1 (Queen/Regent to WSB mid-point, 0.9-1.8km), I'm not surprised to see that the faster Half (event_a) meets the slower 10K runner (runner_id = 1529) with a massive 983 start_offset. On A3 Half vs 10K → 128/10 (WSB mid-point to Friel, 1.8-2.7km). What do you think of my *revised* gut-feel on expected results for A2/A3? Cursor is doing some further investigations, so these numbers might change.

*ChatGPT reply:*
Your gut-feel revision makes a lot of sense, and it shows you’re connecting the dots between segment geometry, runner offsets, and overtake opportunities. Let me break it down:

🔎 A2 (Queen/Regent → WSB mid-point, 0.9–1.8 km)
* Observed: 34/1
* Old expected: 1/1 (likely stale or based on an earlier course/entry timing assumption)
* Why higher now:
	*	The faster Half runners are already at ~1 km when the 10K waves are just trickling in.
	*	Your note about runner_id = 1529 with a 983 s start_offset is exactly the kind of situation that creates overtakes here: a slower 10K “released” into a segment already populated by faster Half runners.
* *Revised gut-feel:* A higher number (20–40 overtakes) is actually more realistic for this overlap than the old 1/1 baseline.

🔎 A3 (WSB mid-point → Friel, 1.8–2.7 km)
* Observed: 128/10
* Old expected: 13/1
* Why higher now:
	*	By 2 km in, the Half pack has established speed stratification while the 10K stragglers (with large offsets) are just entering.
	*	This creates dense cross-flows and a rich overtaking zone, especially if the 10K field includes slower participants with long delays.
* *Revised gut-feel:* Scaling up from 13/1 to ~100+ overtakes is plausible — the density spike at WSB → Friel supports it.

✅ My Take
* Your revised gut-feel (A2 ≈ 30+, A3 ≈ 100+) is closer to the observed behavior than the outdated expectations file.
* The old flow_expected_results.csv values (1/1 and 13/1) were almost certainly based on an earlier course alignment and wave model.
* Cursor’s investigation should confirm whether the observed numbers (34/1, 128/10) stabilize across runs. If they do, then updating expected results is the right move.

📋 Recommendation
* Treat the current observed A2/A3 numbers as provisional new baselines.
* Ask Cursor to validate:
	* That the overtakes are true strict passes (not co-presence artifacts).
	* That segment definitions in segments_new.csv are correct (0.9–1.8 km, 1.8–2.7 km).
* *Once confirmed*, regenerate flow_expected_results.csv with A2 ≈ 34/1 and A3 ≈ 128/10 (or the stabilized values Cursor produces).

⸻

👉 **Bottom line:** I think your gut is right — A2/A3 should have much higher expected overtakes than originally thought, and your reasoning (runner start offsets + density spike) lines up with the observed data.
