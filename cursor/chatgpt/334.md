Title: Issue #334 – Cloud UI not showing captions for density heatmaps

Summary
- Symptom: Density page shows no captions under segment heatmaps on Cloud.
- Expected: Auto-captions appear below heatmaps for each segment.
- Scope: Cloud deployment only; local artifacts include captions during manual runs.

Root Cause
- `captions.json` was not present in GCS under `artifacts/<run_id>/ui/` for recent runs.
- Export flow produced other UI artifacts (`flags.json`, `flow.json`, `schema_density.json`, `segments.geojson`, heatmaps/) but did not upload `captions.json` to GCS.

What Changed (Fix Direction)
- Implemented Option A: generate and upload captions via `StorageService` inside the artifact export.
  - `analytics/export_heatmaps.py` now calls `storage.save_artifact_json("artifacts/<run_id>/ui/captions.json", captions)`.
  - `app/storage_service.py` adds `save_artifact_json()` to write directly to `artifacts/...` (GCS or local).
  - `analytics/export_frontend_artifacts.py` invokes `export_heatmaps_and_captions()` so captions are produced in the same export phase the pipeline already uses.

Current Behavior After Change
- On main, CI successfully builds and deploys; UI artifacts exist, but `captions.json` was still missing for the latest run at time of check. The exporter is now wired to create it; confirm next run artifacts include:
  - `gs://run-density-reports/artifacts/<run_id>/ui/captions.json`

How to Validate
1) After CI finishes Build & Deploy and E2E jobs:
   - Check latest pointer: `gsutil cat gs://run-density-reports/artifacts/latest.json`
   - List UI artifacts: `gsutil ls gs://run-density-reports/artifacts/<run_id>/ui/`
   - Expect `captions.json` present.
2) Open the Cloud UI Density page and select a segment; caption text should render under the heatmap.

Key Files for Review
- `analytics/export_heatmaps.py` – caption generation and StorageService write
- `analytics/export_frontend_artifacts.py` – calls heatmap/caption export during artifacts stage
- `app/storage_service.py` – `save_artifact_json()` for `artifacts/<run_id>/ui/captions.json`
- `config/density_rulebook.yml` – `globals.captioning` thresholds

Notes
- Keeping artifact handling code-driven (not CI-script uploads) preserves local↔cloud parity and reduces maintenance.

Open Question
- If captions still don’t appear after deploy: confirm the exporter runs during CI (logs), verify permissions on bucket, and ensure `bins.parquet` exists (caption logic skips when no bins for a segment).
