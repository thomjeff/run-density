# Improved Per-Event Density Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2025-09-13 01:56:28

**Analysis Period:** 2025-09-13

**Time Bin Size:** 30 seconds

**Total Segments:** 22

**Processed Segments:** 22

**Skipped Segments:** 0

## Methodology

**Units**: Density thresholds use *runners/mÂ²* (areal density). Flow thresholds use *runners/min/m* (throughput per meter of width).

**Notes:**
- `gte` means greater-than-or-equal; used in trigger conditions (e.g., density_gte, flow_gte).
- Start (A1) uses the start_corral schema; other segments use on-course schemas.
- Effective width must reflect any reserved emergency lane at A1.

## Definitions

- **gte**: Greater than or equal to (used in trigger conditions like density_gte, flow_gte)
- **TOT**: Time Over Threshold (seconds above E/F LOS thresholds)
- **LOS**: Level of Service (A=Free Flow, B=Comfortable, C=Moderate, D=Dense, E=Very Dense, F=Extremely Dense)
- **Experienced Density**: What runners actually experience (includes co-present runners from other events)
- **Self Density**: Only that event's runners (not shown in this report)
- **Active Window**: Time period when the event has runners present in the segment
- **Ops Box**: Operational guidance for race marshals and organizers
- **Triggered Actions**: Safety alerts and operational responses when density/flow thresholds are exceeded

## Level of Service Thresholds

| LOS | Areal Density (runners/mÂ²) | Crowd Density (runners/m) | Description |
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| A | 0.00 - 0.36 | 0.00 - 0.20 | Free Flow |
| B | 0.36 - 0.54 | 0.20 - 0.40 | Comfortable |
| C | 0.54 - 0.72 | 0.40 - 0.60 | Moderate |
| D | 0.72 - 1.08 | 0.60 - 0.80 | Dense |
| E | 1.08 - 1.63 | 0.80 - 1.00 | Very Dense |
| F | 1.63+ | 1.00+ | Extremely Dense |

## Event Start Times

## Segment A1 â€” Start to Queen/Regent

### Metrics

| Metric | Value | Units |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Density | 0.20 | p/mÂ² |
| Flow Rate | 0 | p/min/m |
| LOS | A (Start Corral) | â€” |

| Note: LOS here uses start-corral thresholds, not Fruin. Flow-rate governs safety. |

### Operational Implications

â€¢ Start corral release; managed pulses and lane discipline.
â€¢ At LOS A (Free flow), density is acceptable.
â€¢ Flow of 0 p/min/m is within acceptable range.

### Operational Notes

**Access:**
â€¢ Maintain clear emergency lane as planned (effective width reflects this).

**Medical:**
â€¢ SJA roving team staged within 400 m during start window.

**Traffic:**
â€¢ Marshal at funnel entry to maintain cadence and signage compliance.


ðŸ“– Definitions:

â€¢ Density = persons per square meter (p/mÂ²).
â€¢ Flow Rate = persons per minute per meter (p/min/m).
â€¢ `gte` = greater-than-or-equal-to (thresholds are inclusive).
