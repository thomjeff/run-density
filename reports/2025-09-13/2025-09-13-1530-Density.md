**Skipped Segments:** 0

## Methodology

**Units**: Density thresholds use *runners/m²* (areal density). Flow thresholds use *runners/min/m* (throughput per meter of width).

**Notes:**
- `gte` means greater-than-or-equal; used in trigger conditions (e.g., density_gte, flow_gte).
- Start (A1) uses the start_corral schema; other segments use on-course schemas.
- Effective width must reflect any reserved emergency lane at A1.

## Definitions

- **gte**: Greater than or equal to (used in trigger conditions like density_gte, flow_gte)
- **TOT**: Time Over Threshold (seconds above E/F LOS thresholds)
- **LOS**: Level of Service (A=Free Flow, B=Comfortable, C=Moderate, D=Dense, E=Very Dense, F=Extremely Dense)
- **Experienced Density**: What runners actually experience (includes co-present runners from other events)
- **Self Density**: Only that event's runners (not shown in this report)
- **Active Window**: Time period when the event has runners present in the segment
- **Ops Box**: Operational guidance for race marshals and organizers
- **Triggered Actions**: Safety alerts and operational responses when density/flow thresholds are exceeded

## Level of Service Thresholds

| LOS | Areal Density (runners/m²) | Crowd Density (runners/m) | Description |

**Traffic:**
• Marshal at funnel entry to maintain cadence and signage compliance.
