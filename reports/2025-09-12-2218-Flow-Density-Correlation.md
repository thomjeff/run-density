## Segment Correlation Analysis

| Segment | Flow Type | Convergence | Density Class | Flow Intensity | Correlation Type | Insights |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------|

## Methodology

### Density Classification
- **A**: Free Flow (0.00-0.36 runners/m²)
- **B**: Comfortable (0.36-0.54 runners/m²)
- **C**: Moderate (0.54-0.72 runners/m²)
- **D**: Dense (0.72-1.08 runners/m²)
- **E**: Very Dense (1.08-1.63 runners/m²)
- **F**: Extremely Dense (1.63+ runners/m²)

### Flow Intensity Classification
- **High**: ≥50% overtake rate
- **Medium**: 25-49% overtake rate
- **Low**: 1-24% overtake rate
- **None**: 0% overtake rate

### Correlation Types
- **Critical**: High density + High flow intensity
- **Significant**: High density + Medium/High flow intensity
- **Moderate**: Medium density + High flow intensity
- **Flow Dominant**: Low density + High flow intensity
- **Density Dominant**: High density + Low flow intensity
- **Minimal**: Other combinations
- **No Correlation**: No convergence zones

## Recommendations

Based on the correlation analysis:

1. **Monitor Critical Correlations**: Segments with critical correlations require immediate attention
2. **Plan for Significant Correlations**: Segments with significant correlations need careful planning
3. **Optimize Flow Dominant Areas**: Consider flow management strategies for flow-dominant segments
4. **Address Density Dominant Areas**: Implement density reduction strategies for density-dominant segments
