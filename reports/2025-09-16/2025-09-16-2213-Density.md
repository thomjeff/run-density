## Methodology

**Units**: Density thresholds use *runners/m²* (areal density). Flow thresholds use *runners/min/m* (throughput per meter of width).

**Notes:**
- `gte` means greater-than-or-equal; used in trigger conditions (e.g., density_gte, flow_gte).
- Start (A1) uses the start_corral schema; other segments use on-course schemas.
- Effective width must reflect any reserved emergency lane at A1.

## Event Start Times

| Event | Start Time | Total Participants |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Full | 07:00:00 | 368 |
| 10K | 07:20:00 | 618 |
| Half | 07:40:00 | 912 |
| **Total** | - | **1,898** |
