## Legend

- **TOT**: Time Over Threshold (seconds above E/F LOS thresholds)
- **LOS**: Level of Service (A=Comfortable, B=Good, C=Moderate, D=Busy, E=Very Busy, F=Critical)
- **Experienced Density**: What runners actually experience (includes co-present runners from other events)
- **Self Density**: Only that event's runners (not shown in this report)
- **Active Window**: Time period when the event has runners present in the segment

## Level of Service Thresholds

This concentration may impact runner flow and safety. Consider:
- Widening the segment if possible
- Implementing flow control measures
- Monitoring for bottlenecks


**Mitigations:**
- Deploy additional marshals at start area, implement wave starts if needed

**Ops Box:**
- **Access:** Maintain clear start area access for emergency vehicles
- **Medical:** Position medical tent near start, ensure AED availability
- **Traffic:** Coordinate with traffic management for start area road closures
- **Peak:** Peak concurrency: 861 runners at 07:10:00–08:30:00

**Safety Alerts:**
- **SAFETY ALERT**: High density detected in segment A3.
Consider implementing crowd control measures.

- **FLOW CONTROL**: Consider implementing flow control measures in segment A3
to manage density and prevent bottlenecks.

- **MONITORING**: Segment A3 should be closely monitored for density changes
during peak runner flow periods.

### Operational Insights

**Drivers:**
- **Medium Density**: Segment B1 (Friel to 10K Turn) shows moderate density with 0.4490322580645162 runners per meter.
This level is manageable but should be monitored for changes.


**Mitigations:**
- Place directional signage, deploy marshals at turn points

**Ops Box:**
- **Access:** Keep turn areas clear for emergency access
- **Medical:** Position medical support near turn points
- **Traffic:** Deploy marshals for directional guidance
- **Peak:** Peak concurrency: 696 runners during turn execution

**Safety Alerts:**
- **MONITORING**: Segment B1 should be closely monitored for density changes
during peak runner flow periods.
