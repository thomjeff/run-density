Unit Tests for Flow Analysis Core Behaviors
===========================================

Small, fast, assertion-based unit tests targeting the fixed behaviors:
- Fraction clamping to [0,1] with reason codes
- True pass vs co-presence separation
- Convergence point consistency
- Binning enforcement

These complement the existing integration tests in temporal_flow_tests.py
