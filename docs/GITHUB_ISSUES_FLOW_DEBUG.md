# GitHub Issues: Flow Module Systematic Debugging

## Main Issue: Flow Module Critical Debugging and Validation

### Issue Title
**CRITICAL: Flow Module Systematic Debugging - Remove Hardcoded Values, Fix Temporal Analysis**

### Issue Body
```markdown
## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE: Flow Module Analysis Failures

### Problem Summary
The flow module has **CRITICAL ISSUES** identified through comprehensive analysis:

1. **HARDCODED VALUES** in `app/overlap.py` (violates core principles)
2. **Unit confusion** - fractions displayed as absolute values
3. **Missing event pairs** in schema conversion
4. **Co-presence counting** instead of true overtaking detection
5. **100m snapshot limitation** missing full segment analysis
6. **Start time inconsistencies** affecting all calculations

### Impact
- **Unrealistic overtaking percentages** (94.8% at L1)
- **Missing convergence segments** (F1 pairs, B2)
- **Validation failures** against known good data
- **Broken temporal analysis** logic

### Root Cause Analysis
- Hardcoded convergence points masking real temporal analysis failures
- Schema conversion dropping event pairs
- Co-presence counting inflating overtaking statistics
- Unit representation confusion causing arithmetic errors

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Remove ALL hardcoded values
- [ ] Achieve >90% convergence count match with old reports
- [ ] Reduce unrealistic overtaking percentages to <60%
- [ ] Restore all missing event pairs
- [ ] Implement true pass detection
- [ ] Fix unit labeling and representation

### Dependencies
- Requires systematic approach with clear commit points
- Must maintain backward compatibility with main.py and dependent modules
- Needs validation framework for each phase

### Phase 1: Schema & Conversion Validation

#### Issue 1.1: Audit segments_new.csv Conversion Logic
```markdown
## Issue Title
**Phase 1.1: Audit segments_new.csv Conversion Logic**

### Description
Validate the `convert_segments_new_to_flow_format` function to ensure all segments and event pairs are correctly generated.

### Tasks
- [ ] Audit conversion function for missing event pairs
- [ ] Verify all `overtake_flag=y` segments are preserved
- [ ] Check `flow_type` assignments are correct
- [ ] Validate distance mappings for all events

### Expected Outcomes
- All expected event pairs generated (F1 should have 3 pairs)
- No segments dropped during conversion
- Clear audit trail of conversion process

### Validation Tests
- Compare old vs new pair generation
- Verify F1 generates: 10K/Half, 10K/Full, Half/Full
- Check B2 segment is not missing

### Commit Strategy
- Commit after each validation test passes
- Tag as `v1.6.3-phase1.1-validation`

    for j, event_b in enumerate(events):
        if i != j:  # Include both directions
            # Generate pair
```

#     return 2.36
# if from_km == 2.7 and to_km == 4.25 and eventA == "10K" and eventB == "Full":

#### Issue 2.2: Fix Unit Representation and Labeling
```markdown
## Issue Title
**Phase 2.2: Fix Unit Representation and Labeling**

### Description
Fix the confusion between normalized fractions and absolute values in convergence point representation.

### Tasks
- [ ] Store both absolute and normalized convergence points
- [ ] Fix unit labeling in reports (no "km" on fractions)
- [ ] Implement consistent rounding policies
- [ ] Add clear unit labels in all outputs

### Code Changes
```python
# Store both values:
convergence_point_km = cp_km  # Absolute km
convergence_point_frac = (cp_km - from_km_a) / (to_km_a - from_km_a)  # 0-1 fraction

# Display clearly:
"Convergence Point (fraction): 0.46"
"Convergence Point (km): 1.31"
```

### Expected Outcomes
- Clear separation of absolute vs normalized values
- No unit confusion in reports
- Consistent arithmetic validation

### Validation Tests

- Test arithmetic consistency

### Commit Strategy
