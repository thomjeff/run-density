# Sample User Journey: Race Director Analysis Workflow

## Scenario: Pre-Race Analysis for Course Optimization

### User Profile
- **Name**: Sarah Chen
- **Role**: Race Director for City Marathon
- **Experience**: 5+ years organizing multi-distance events
- **Goal**: Optimize course layout to reduce bottlenecks

### Journey Steps

#### 1. Initial Setup (5 minutes)
- Sarah opens the Race Analysis Dashboard
- She's greeted with a clean interface showing recent analyses
- Clicks "New Analysis" to start fresh analysis
- System shows default data files are loaded

#### 2. Event Configuration (3 minutes)
- Sarah reviews default start times:
  - Full Marathon: 07:00:00 (420 minutes)
  - 10K: 07:20:00 (440 minutes) 
  - Half Marathon: 07:40:00 (460 minutes)
- She adjusts 10K start time to 07:25:00 based on expected participant volume
- Selects "Flow + Density" analysis type
- Keeps default parameters (5s overlap, 100m conflict length)

#### 3. Analysis Execution (8 minutes)
- Sarah clicks "Run Analysis"
- System shows real-time progress:
  - "Analyzing 1,899 runners across 22 segments..."
  - "Processing temporal flow patterns..."
  - "Calculating density metrics..."
- Progress bar indicates 60% complete
- Estimated time remaining: 3 minutes

#### 4. Results Review (10 minutes)
- Analysis completes successfully
- Sarah reviews results in tabbed interface:

**Flow Analysis Tab**:
- Sees 19 segments with overtaking patterns
- 3 segments with merge points
- 7 segments with no significant flow issues
- Clicks on segment B2 (10K Turn to Friel) for details
- Reviews convergence analysis showing 77 Full runners overtaking 54 10K runners

**Density Analysis Tab**:
- Examines density heat map
- Identifies high-density zones around mile 2.5
- Reviews sustained density periods
- Notes potential bottleneck at segment A3

**Map Visualization Tab**:
- Views interactive course map
- Toggles between flow and density overlays
- Zooms into problematic areas
- Sees color-coded segments with convergence points

#### 5. Decision Making (5 minutes)
- Sarah identifies key issues:
  - Segment B2: Significant overtaking at 10K turn
  - Segment A3: High density with potential bottleneck
  - Overall: 15 segments show convergence patterns
- She notes these for course marshal placement

#### 6. Report Generation (2 minutes)
- Sarah downloads comprehensive report package:
  - `race_analysis_2025_flow_report.md`
  - `race_analysis_2025_flow_data.csv`
  - `race_analysis_2025_density_report.md`
- She also saves map screenshots for marshal briefing

#### 7. Follow-up Actions (3 minutes)
- Sarah emails reports to course marshal coordinator
- Schedules briefing meeting for next week
- Plans to re-run analysis with updated participant numbers closer to race day
