## 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED AND FIXED**

### Issue #239: Runner Mapping Placeholder Bug

#### Discovery
While reviewing Issue #236 operational intelligence reports, you noticed:
> "Why a WATCH when Density = 0.00?"

ChatGPT's analysis revealed:
- Densities were implausibly low (0.002-0.004 p/m²)
- Displayed as 0.00 p/m² in reports (rounded)
- Expected values: 0.20-0.80 p/m² based on existing segment analysis

#### Root Cause
**Line 2199** in `app/density_report.py` (`build_runner_window_mapping()`):
```python
num_runners = random.randint(0, 5)  # PLACEHOLDER - never replaced!
```

**Impact:**
- Bins contained 0-5 random runners instead of actual race data
- Densities 200x+ too low
- Operational intelligence meaningless (based on noise)
- Violated "no hardcoded values" principle from Pre-task Safeguards

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

### Implementation (3 commits)

#### 1. **Replace Placeholder with Real Runner Mapping** (`d87c36c`)
```python
# OLD (Random placeholder):
num_runners = random.randint(0, 5)

# NEW (Real runner data):
- Load pace data from data/runners.csv
- Load segment km ranges from data/segments.csv per event
- Calculate runner positions: time_at_km = start_time + offset + pace * km
- Check if runner in segment during time window
- Map to pos_m and speed_mps arrays
```

#### 2. **Fix Report Timing** (`2ab5769`)
**Problem:** Report generated BEFORE bins, so operational intelligence loaded OLD bins

**Solution:**
1. Generate initial report WITHOUT operational intelligence
2. Generate bins with real runner data
3. REGENERATE report WITH operational intelligence using fresh bins
4. Overwrite with enhanced report

#### 3. **Documentation** (`b2535cc`)
Updated CHANGELOG with bug details, fix, and validation results

## 📊 **VALIDATION RESULTS**

### Before vs After

| Metric | Before (Bug) | After (Fixed) | Change | Status |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Peak Density** | 0.0040 p/m² | **0.8330 p/m²** | 208x | ✅ |
| **F1 Peak** | 0.0040 p/m² | **0.8330 p/m²** | 208x | ✅ Pinch point |
| **I1 Peak** | 0.0040 p/m² | **0.6810 p/m²** | 170x | ✅ Narrow segment |
| **A1 Peak** | 0.0040 p/m² | **0.5000 p/m²** | 125x | ✅ Start area |
| **A2 Peak** | 0.0040 p/m² | **0.2540 p/m²** | 63x | ✅ Normal flow |

### Why Bins Show Higher Values (Expected Behavior)
- **Bins are fine-grained**: 0.2km slices (vs full segments 1-3km)
- **Bins capture peaks**: Specific hotspots within segments
- **Segment averages smooth peaks**: Overall average includes lower-density areas
- **Example**: F1 segment average = 0.03 p/m², but peak bin within it = 0.833 p/m²

### Realistic Value Confirmation
✅ **F1: 0.833 p/m²** - Known pinch point on narrow trail  
✅ **I1: 0.681 p/m²** - Narrow segment with high flow  
✅ **A1: 0.500 p/m²** - Start area concentration  
✅ **A2: 0.254 p/m²** - Normal flow conditions  
✅ **Ordering**: F1 > I1 > A1 > A2 > A3 (correct progression)

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### E2E Tests: ✅ ALL PASSED
```
✅ Health: OK
✅ Ready: OK
✅ Density Report: OK
✅ Temporal Flow Report: OK
```

### Operational Intelligence Output
- **Total Bins**: 8,800 (0.2km × 60-second slices)
- **Flagged Bins**: 445 (5.1% - top 5% utilization)
- **Peak Density**: 0.8330 p/m² (F1 segment)
- **Worst LOS**: B (Stable flow, minor restrictions)
- **Severity**: All WATCH (utilization-based)

### Artifacts Generated
- ✅ `density.md` with operational intelligence (realistic values)
- ✅ `tooltips.json` (445 flagged bins for map)
- ✅ `bins.parquet` (8,800 bins with realistic data)
- ✅ `segment_windows_from_bins.parquet`

## 🎯 **READY FOR YOUR REVIEW**

### What to Check
1. **Density values**: Do 0.2-0.8 p/m² values make sense for your race?
2. **F1 peak (0.833)**: Does this match your known pinch point on narrow trail?
3. **Flagged segments**: Do I1, A1, A2 locations make operational sense?
4. **Operational intelligence**: Does the Executive Summary provide useful insights?

### Testing Commands
```bash
# View latest density report
cat reports/2025-10-14/2025-10-14-1923-Density.md | head -80

# Check bins data quality
python -c "
import pandas as pd
bins = pd.read_parquet('reports/2025-10-14/bins.parquet')
print(f'Peak: {bins[\"density\"].max():.4f} p/m²')
print(f'P95: {bins[\"density\"].quantile(0.95):.4f} p/m²')
"

# View tooltips for map
cat reports/2025-10-14/tooltips.json | jq '.[:3]'

## 📝 **KEY LEARNINGS**

1. **Always check actual values** - Don't trust formatting alone
2. **User feedback is critical** - "Why a WATCH when Density = 0.00?" led to discovery
3. **No placeholders in production paths** - Even if technically not "hardcoded"
4. **Timing matters** - Report generation order affects data quality
5. **Pre-task safeguards work** - "no hardcoded values" principle caught this
