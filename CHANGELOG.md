### CRITICAL FIX: Heatmap Display in Cloud Run Production

**Issue #332 Complete**: GCS Signed URL Generation for Heatmap Display

#### The Problem
- **Symptom**: Heatmaps not displaying in production Cloud Run environment
- **Root Cause**: API returning public URLs for private GCS bucket → 403 Forbidden errors
- **Impact**: Users unable to view heatmap visualizations for race segments

#### The Solution
- **Service Account Configuration**: Created dedicated `run-density-web` service account with signing capabilities
- **Base64 Key Management**: Service account key encoded as environment variable for secure access
- **Signed URL Generation**: 24-hour signed URLs with proper authentication parameters
- **Environment-Aware Storage**: Unified storage service handling both local and GCS modes

#### Technical Implementation
- **Storage Class Refactor**: Complete rewrite of `app/storage.py` for proper GCS signed URL generation
- **API Integration**: Updated `app/routes/api_density.py` to use new storage methods
- **Service Account Setup**: 
  - Created `run-density-web@run-density.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
  - Granted `roles/storage.objectViewer` and `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`
  - Attached to Cloud Run service for signing operations
- **Credential Management**: Base64 encoded service account key passed as environment variable

#### Files Modified
- `app/storage.py` - Complete refactor for GCS signed URL generation
- `app/routes/api_density.py` - Updated to use new storage methods
- `app/storage_service.py` - Enhanced bucket existence check handling
- `docs/ISSUE_332_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive root cause analysis and lessons learned

#### Verification Results
- **A1 Segment**: ✅ `https://storage.googleapis.com/run-density-reports/artifacts/2025-10-25/ui/heatmaps/A1.png?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&...`
- **B2 Segment**: ✅ Valid signed URL with authentication parameters
- **F1 Segment**: ✅ Working heatmap display in production UI
- **L1 Segment**: ✅ All segments now displaying correctly

#### Lessons Learned
- **Authentication ≠ Signing**: Default Cloud Run credentials can't create signed URLs
- **Service Account Keys**: Required for cryptographic signing operations
- **Variable Scope**: Must handle all code paths in exception handling
- **Traffic Routing**: New Cloud Run revisions don't automatically get traffic

## [v1.6.43] - 2025-10-21

### CRITICAL BUG FIX: Report Downloads in Cloud Run and Local Environments

**Context**: This was an emergency hotfix session conducted directly on the main branch due to the critical nature of the download failures affecting core user functionality.

#### The Problem
- **Symptom**: Report downloads failing in both local and Cloud Run environments
- **Local Error**: `{"detail":"Access denied"}` - 403 Forbidden
- **Cloud Run Error**: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'encode'` - resulted in 0-byte downloads
- **Impact**: Users unable to download any report files (`.md`, `.csv`) from the Reports UI page

#### Root Causes Identified

**1. Path Validation Mismatch**
- Browser requests included `reports/` prefix (e.g., `reports/2025-10-21/file.md`)
- Validation logic expected paths without prefix (e.g., `2025-10-21/file.md`)
- Result: Legitimate requests rejected with "Access denied"

**2. Double Path Prefix Bug (Local)**
- File path construction created `reports/reports/2025-10-21/file.md` when path already contained `reports/`
- Result: File not found errors after fixing validation

**3. GCS Path Construction Bug (Cloud Run)**
- Similar double-prefix issue for GCS paths
- Result: GCS blob lookups failing

**4. NoneType Handling Bug (Cloud Run)**
- `StorageService._load_from_gcs()` returned `None` when files not found
- `None` passed directly to `StreamingResponse` causing `AttributeError` during encoding
- Result: 0-byte downloads and cryptic error messages

**5. Environment Detection Gap**
- Download endpoint didn't differentiate between local filesystem and GCS reads for report files
- Cloud Run environment needed explicit GCS read logic
- Result: Cloud Run trying to read from ephemeral local filesystem

#### The Fix (5 Commits)

**Commit 1**: `1f4b961` - Initial path validation normalization
- Strip `reports/` prefix before validation to handle browser-encoded URLs

**Commit 2**: `b72d3ed` - Switch to StorageService
- Replace legacy `storage.py` with `StorageService` for consistency

**Commit 3**: `c58ee1e` - Fix NoneType error
- Add explicit `None` checks before encoding content

**Commit 4**: `25196a6` - Comprehensive ChatGPT fix
- Complete rewrite of `download_report()` endpoint with:
  - Robust GCS path normalization in `_load_from_gcs()`
  - Explicit `None` content checks with proper 404 responses
  - Safe UTF-8 encoding with error handling
  - `BytesIO` for `StreamingResponse` compatibility
  - Descriptive logging at every step

**Commit 5**: `9939807` - Environment-aware file reads
- Add local filesystem support for report files when not in Cloud Run
- Use `storage_service.config.use_cloud_storage` to differentiate environments
- Handle both local (`open()`) and GCS (`_load_from_gcs()`) reads

#### Files Modified
- `app/storage_service.py`:
  - Enhanced `_load_from_gcs()` with path normalization and logging
  - Added support for `reports/` prefix stripping
- `app/routes/api_reports.py`:
  - Complete rewrite of `download_report()` endpoint
  - Environment-aware file reading (local vs GCS)
  - Robust error handling and logging
  - Safe content encoding

#### Testing & Validation
- ✅ Local environment: Report downloads working (`.md`, `.csv`)
- ✅ Cloud Run environment: Report downloads working (confirmed via browser and curl)
- ✅ Path validation: Correctly handles browser-encoded URLs with `reports/` prefix
- ✅ Error handling: Proper 404 responses for missing files
- ✅ Logging: Comprehensive logs for debugging future issues

#### Architectural Insights
This fix highlighted the critical importance of:
1. **Environment-aware storage access** - local filesystem vs GCS must be explicit
2. **Defensive `None` handling** - never pass `None` to response encoders
3. **Path normalization** - consistent path handling across environments
4. **Comprehensive logging** - essential for debugging cloud-only issues

#### ChatGPT Consultation
This fix was developed with extensive architectural guidance from ChatGPT, which provided:
- Root cause analysis of the NoneType error
- Comprehensive patch for the download endpoint
- Best practices for GCS path normalization
- Environment detection patterns

#### Known Limitations
- Fix was applied directly to main branch (emergency hotfix)
- No unit tests added (future improvement opportunity)
- Legacy `storage.py` still exists (scheduled for deprecation)

#### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests for download endpoint
- [ ] Deprecate legacy `storage.py` module
- [ ] Consolidate storage access patterns across all routes
- [ ] Add integration tests for GCS file operations

## [Unreleased] - feat/236-operational-intelligence-reports

### Issue #239 - CRITICAL BUG FIX: Runner Mapping in bins_accumulator
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Realistic density values restored
- **Branch**: `feat/236-operational-intelligence-reports`
- **Critical Fix**: Replaced placeholder random data with actual runner mapping

#### The Bug
- **Line 2199**: `random.randint(0, 5)` placeholder never replaced with real runner data
- **Impact**: Densities 200x+ too low (0.004 vs 0.20-0.80 p/m²)
- **Discovered**: During Issue #236 testing, values showed as 0.00 p/m²

#### The Fix
1. **Runner Mapping**: Implemented proper mapping using pace data, start times, offsets
2. **Segment Ranges**: Load per-event km ranges from segments.csv
3. **Position Calculation**: Calculate runner positions based on pace and time
4. **Timing Fix**: Regenerate report AFTER bins so operational intelligence uses fresh data

#### Results After Fix
- **Peak Density**: 0.8330 p/m² (was 0.0040) - 208x increase ✅
- **F1 Peak**: 0.8330 p/m² (LOS B - pinch point) ✅
- **A1 Peak**: 0.5000 p/m² (LOS B - start area) ✅
- **A2 Peak**: 0.2540 p/m² (LOS A - normal) ✅
- **Realistic Ordering**: F1 > I1 > A1 > A2 > A3 ✅

### Issue #236 - Operational Intelligence Reports (Phase 2)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Unified density report with operational intelligence
- **Branch**: `feat/236-operational-intelligence-reports`
- **Achievement**: Integrated operational intelligence into existing density.md report

#### Implementation ✅
- **Schema Fixes**: Updated `app/io_bins.py` to prioritize bins.parquet (8,800 bins with spatial data) over segment_windows_from_bins.parquet (temporal aggregations)

## [v1.3.8] - 2025-08-31

## [v1.3.7] - 2025-08-31

## [v1.3.6] - 2025-08-30

## [v1.3.5] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- `/version` endpoint now exposes app version, git SHA, and build timestamp.
- New `/api/density.summary` endpoint for compact zone reporting (paired with new `smoke-summary-*` Make targets).
- Extended `/api/peaks.csv` to include `zone_by` and `zone_cuts` headers, with support for both areal and crowd metrics.
- New Makefile smoke tests:
  - `smoke-areal` and `smoke-crowd` for density checks.
  - `smoke-peaks`, `smoke-peaks-areal`, and `smoke-peaks-crowd` for CSV validation.
  - `smoke-summary-areal` and `smoke-summary-crowd` for compact summaries.

### Changed
- Improved error messages: `_fail_422` and `_validate_overlaps` now surface `seg_id` context where available.
- Cleaned up code quality in `density.py`:
  - Removed duplicate imports.
  - Added proper type hints and standardized constants.
  - Replaced “magic numbers” with named constants (e.g., `EPSILON`).

### Fixed
- Corrected async handling in endpoints using `Request.json()` (notably `/api/peaks.csv`).
- Standardized error handling across endpoints for consistent 422 vs 500 responses.

## [1.3.4] – 2025-08-27

### Added
- Custom zoning metric & thresholds
- New zoneMetric request field: "areal" (default) or "crowd".
- Optional zones object to override 5-band cuts:
- zones.areal: e.g. [7.5, 15, 30, 50]
- zones.crowd: e.g. [1, 2, 4, 8] (pax / m²)
- Crowd density output (peak.crowd_density) alongside peak.areal_density.
- CSV export endpoint: POST /api/peaks.csv streams per-segment peaks (includes areal, crowd, zone).

### Changed
- Per-segment binning: very short segments now auto-reduce stepKm so each span has ≥1 bin.
- Zoning logic refactored:
- Generic _zone_from_metric + _zone_for_density choose cuts from zones and metric from zoneMetric.
- Bi-direction segments halve effective width before density.
- Validation & errors: clearer 422s for missing start times, invalid thresholds, or bad params.

### Fixed
- Eliminated intermittent 500s caused by stale helpers and unbound loop vars during recent refactors.
- peaks.csv now streams correctly and respects zoneMetric/zones.

### Dev / DX
- New Makefile smokes:
- make smoke-areal — custom areal cuts
- make smoke-crowd — custom crowd cuts
- Debug traces are bounded (trace[:50]) when ?debug=true to keep payloads lightweight.

### Compatibility
- Request remains backward-compatible:
- If zones is omitted, defaults apply.
- If zoneMetric is omitted, "areal" is used.
- Existing fields (paceCsv, overlapsCsv, startTimes, stepKm, timeWindow, depth_m) unchanged.


## [1.3.3] – 2025-08-27

### 🔧 Fixes & Improvements
- **Shared Start Window Fix**  
  Corrected logic so overlapping events respect their distinct start times rather than producing artificial overlaps.  
  *Example: A1a (Start to Queen/Regent) now shows only 10K counts at 07:20, Half is correctly excluded.*

- **New Metric: `crowd_density`**  
  Added a human-intuitive density measure expressed as *runners per m²*, configurable with a `depth_m` parameter (default: 3.0m).  
  This complements `areal_density` and provides better interpretability of congestion.

- **Start-Line Splits**  
  Segments A1, A2, A3 were subdivided into finer spans (~0.9 km each) to capture how the field disperses downstream from the start.  
  Early peaks are concentrated at 0.0 km, then densities taper in later sub-segments.

- **Stability**  
  Local and prod smoke tests passed; 40 segments returned.  
  Non-green congestion zones align with expected field sizes and course widths.

### 📊 Sample Outputs
- **A1a**: peak = 586, areal_density = 58.6, crowd_density = 19.5 → *dark-red*.  
- **A1b**: peak = 20, areal_density = 2.0, crowd_density = 0.67 → *green*.  
- **A2a/A3a**: peak values corrected, tapering visible over ~1 km.

**Next steps (v1.3.4-dev):**
- Add bib-level trace outputs.  
- Validate bi-direction edge cases (e.g., H3).  
- Explore export options for human-readable outputs alongside JSON.
  
## [1.3.2] – 2025-08-27
### Added
- Per-segment debug view: GET /api/density?seg_id=<ID>&debug=true now returns a focused segment with first_overlap and a short trace sample for quick inspection.
- Query filter: Support ?seg_id=<ID> to compute/return a single segment from overlaps.csv.

### Changed
- Canonical overlaps schema: API and engine now only accept seg_id (we removed legacy segment_id).
- Start time model: {"10K": 440} is now a first-class field (no leading underscore). Internal model normalized (TenK) with alias mapping for request/response stability.
- Areal density sanity: Correct handling of minutes-per-km (pace) and direction/width rules: direction: "bi" halves the effective width (width_m / 2); Areal density reported as people per m² using the effective width.
- Main ↔ engine alignment: main.py now calls run_density(payload, seg_id_filter=…, debug=…) to prevent drift and 422/500 mismatches.

### Fixed
- Intermittent 422/500 errors stemming from mismatched parameter names and optional JSON fields.
- Local/prod smoke parity (both return stable counts; A1 spot-check matches across environments).
- Minor CSV header gotchas (e.g., accidental segmenttolabel) — stricter validation paths.

### Developer experience
- Make targets stabilized (run-local, stop-local, smoke-local, smoke-prod) on port 8081.
- Clearer error surfaces in /api/density (500 returns {"error": "..."}" with concise message).
- Pinned/verified deps (FastAPI / Starlette / Pydantic / Requests) for Python 3.12 runtime.
