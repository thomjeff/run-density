# Changelog

## [v1.3.9] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- **Overlap Narrative Text API** (`/api/overlap.narrative.text`) - Human-readable overlap analysis with summary statistics
- **Overlap CSV Export API** (`/api/overlap.narrative.csv`) - Export overlap analysis to CSV with timestamped filenames
- **Dynamic Segment Loading** - All endpoints now load segments from `overlaps.csv` instead of hardcoded lists
- **Makefile Commands** - `make overlaps` for narrative text and `make overlaps-csv` for CSV export
- **Start Offset Support** - Accurate runner timing with individual start delays from `your_pace_data.csv`
- **Summary Statistics** - Total segments, overlap count, overlap rate, and top 3 segments by peak runner count
- **Enhanced Narrative Format** - Emojis, clear formatting, fastest/slowest runner labels, and direction indicators
- **Segment Filtering** - Support for `?seg_id=` parameter to analyze individual segments
- **Tolerance Parameters** - Configurable time tolerance for overlap detection

### Changed
- **Architecture Separation** - Moved overlap logic from `density.py` to dedicated `overlap.py` module

- **API Version**: Updated to v1.3.9-dev
- **File Structure**: Clean separation between density and overlap functionality
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for CSV loading failures

## [v1.3.8] - 2025-08-31

## [v1.3.7] - 2025-08-31

## [v1.3.6] - 2025-08-30

## [v1.3.5] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- `/version` endpoint now exposes app version, git SHA, and build timestamp.
- New `/api/density.summary` endpoint for compact zone reporting (paired with new `smoke-summary-*` Make targets).
- Extended `/api/peaks.csv` to include `zone_by` and `zone_cuts` headers, with support for both areal and crowd metrics.
- New Makefile smoke tests:
  - `smoke-areal` and `smoke-crowd` for density checks.
  - `smoke-peaks`, `smoke-peaks-areal`, and `smoke-peaks-crowd` for CSV validation.
  - `smoke-summary-areal` and `smoke-summary-crowd` for compact summaries.

### Changed
- Improved error messages: `_fail_422` and `_validate_overlaps` now surface `seg_id` context where available.
- Cleaned up code quality in `density.py`:
  - Removed duplicate imports.
  - Added proper type hints and standardized constants.
  - Replaced ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù with named constants (e.g., `EPSILON`).

### Fixed
- Corrected async handling in endpoints using `Request.json()` (notably `/api/peaks.csv`).
- Standardized error handling across endpoints for consistent 422 vs 500 responses.

## [1.3.4] ‚Äì 2025-08-27

### Added
- Custom zoning metric & thresholds
- New zoneMetric request field: "areal" (default) or "crowd".
- Optional zones object to override 5-band cuts:
- zones.areal: e.g. [7.5, 15, 30, 50]
- zones.crowd: e.g. [1, 2, 4, 8] (pax / m¬≤)
- Crowd density output (peak.crowd_density) alongside peak.areal_density.
- CSV export endpoint: POST /api/peaks.csv streams per-segment peaks (includes areal, crowd, zone).

### Changed
- Per-segment binning: very short segments now auto-reduce stepKm so each span has ‚â•1 bin.
- Zoning logic refactored:
- Generic _zone_from_metric + _zone_for_density choose cuts from zones and metric from zoneMetric.
- Bi-direction segments halve effective width before density.
- Validation & errors: clearer 422s for missing start times, invalid thresholds, or bad params.

### Fixed
- Eliminated intermittent 500s caused by stale helpers and unbound loop vars during recent refactors.
- peaks.csv now streams correctly and respects zoneMetric/zones.

### Dev / DX
- New Makefile smokes:
- make smoke-areal ‚Äî custom areal cuts
- make smoke-crowd ‚Äî custom crowd cuts
- Debug traces are bounded (trace[:50]) when ?debug=true to keep payloads lightweight.

### Compatibility
- Request remains backward-compatible:
- If zones is omitted, defaults apply.
- If zoneMetric is omitted, "areal" is used.
- Existing fields (paceCsv, overlapsCsv, startTimes, stepKm, timeWindow, depth_m) unchanged.


## [1.3.3] ‚Äì 2025-08-27

### üîß Fixes & Improvements
- **Shared Start Window Fix**  
  Corrected logic so overlapping events respect their distinct start times rather than producing artificial overlaps.  
  *Example: A1a (Start to Queen/Regent) now shows only 10K counts at 07:20, Half is correctly excluded.*

- **New Metric: `crowd_density`**  
  Added a human-intuitive density measure expressed as *runners per m¬≤*, configurable with a `depth_m` parameter (default: 3.0m).  
  This complements `areal_density` and provides better interpretability of congestion.

- **Start-Line Splits**  
  Segments A1, A2, A3 were subdivided into finer spans (~0.9 km each) to capture how the field disperses downstream from the start.  
  Early peaks are concentrated at 0.0 km, then densities taper in later sub-segments.

- **Stability**  
  Local and prod smoke tests passed; 40 segments returned.  
  Non-green congestion zones align with expected field sizes and course widths.

### üìä Sample Outputs
- **A1a**: peak = 586, areal_density = 58.6, crowd_density = 19.5 ‚Üí *dark-red*.  
- **A1b**: peak = 20, areal_density = 2.0, crowd_density = 0.67 ‚Üí *green*.  
- **A2a/A3a**: peak values corrected, tapering visible over ~1 km.

**Next steps (v1.3.4-dev):**
- Add bib-level trace outputs.  
- Validate bi-direction edge cases (e.g., H3).  
- Explore export options for human-readable outputs alongside JSON.
  
## [1.3.2] ‚Äì 2025-08-27
### Added
- Per-segment debug view: GET /api/density?seg_id=<ID>&debug=true now returns a focused segment with first_overlap and a short trace sample for quick inspection.
- Query filter: Support ?seg_id=<ID> to compute/return a single segment from overlaps.csv.

### Changed
- Canonical overlaps schema: API and engine now only accept seg_id (we removed legacy segment_id).
- Start time model: {"10K": 440} is now a first-class field (no leading underscore). Internal model normalized (TenK) with alias mapping for request/response stability.
- Areal density sanity: Correct handling of minutes-per-km (pace) and direction/width rules: direction: "bi" halves the effective width (width_m / 2); Areal density reported as people per m¬≤ using the effective width.
- Main ‚Üî engine alignment: main.py now calls run_density(payload, seg_id_filter=‚Ä¶, debug=‚Ä¶) to prevent drift and 422/500 mismatches.

### Fixed
- Intermittent 422/500 errors stemming from mismatched parameter names and optional JSON fields.
- Local/prod smoke parity (both return stable counts; A1 spot-check matches across environments).
- Minor CSV header gotchas (e.g., accidental segmenttolabel) ‚Äî stricter validation paths.

### Developer experience
- Make targets stabilized (run-local, stop-local, smoke-local, smoke-prod) on port 8081.
- Clearer error surfaces in /api/density (500 returns {"error": "..."}" with concise message).
- Pinned/verified deps (FastAPI / Starlette / Pydantic / Requests) for Python 3.12 runtime.
