# Updated Work Plan - September 12, 2025

## Issue Status Review Results

Based on your feedback and current state analysis:

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED ISSUES (Need to Close)**

1. **Issue #100** - Add Metadata Fields to Temporal Flow CSV Report
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Metadata fields already added
   - **Evidence**: Flow.csv now includes: `analysis_timestamp`, `app_version`, `environment`, `data_source`, `start_times`, `min_overlap_duration`, `conflict_length_m`
   - **Action**: Close issue with comment about completion

2. **Issue #121** - Reorganize flow.csv Column Grouping
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Column order looks good
   - **Evidence**: Current Flow.csv has logical grouping with metadata fields at end
   - **Action**: Close issue with comment about completion

3. **Issue #113** - Counterflow Runner IDs Bug
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Bug is fixed
   - **Evidence**: Current Flow.csv shows proper runner IDs in sample columns for counterflow entries
   - **Action**: Close issue with comment about resolution

### **üîç NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

4. **Issue #115** - E2E Auto-copy Functionality
   - **Status**: ‚ùì **UNCLEAR** - Need to verify if implemented
   - **Evidence**: Issue still open, need to check if auto-copy is working
   - **Action**: Test E2E module to see if files are auto-copied

5. **Issue #122** - Flow Calculation Anomalies
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ **LIKELY RESOLVED** - F1 Half/10K unique_encounters down from 401,230 to 81,423
   - **Evidence**: Current results show much more reasonable values
   - **Action**: Verify against expected results and close if resolved

6. **Issue #91** - Counterflow Algorithm
   - **Status**: ‚ùì **NEEDS REVIEW** - Algorithm may have changed since issue creation
   - **Evidence**: Current flow results look reasonable, need to verify if concerns still exist
   - **Action**: Review current algorithm against issue concerns

### **üö® HIGH PRIORITY - NEW ISSUE**

7. **CI Workflow Failures** - **NEW ISSUE TO CREATE**
   - **Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - CI consistently failing
   - **Problem**: Version consistency check failing (code=v1.6.18, git_tag=v1.6.19)
   - **Action**: Create GitHub issue and fix today

## **UPDATED WORK PLAN FOR TODAY**

### **Morning (High Priority)**
1. **Create CI Workflow Issue** - Document the version consistency failure
2. **Fix CI Workflow** - Update hardcoded version in app/main.py
3. **Test Issue #115** - Verify E2E auto-copy functionality
4. **Close Completed Issues** - #100, #121, #113 with completion comments

### **Afternoon (Investigation)**
5. **Review Issue #122** - Verify F1 anomaly is resolved
6. **Review Issue #91** - Check if counterflow algorithm concerns still exist
7. **Run E2E Tests** - Ensure everything works after CI fix

### **Evening (Cleanup)**
8. **Close Resolved Issues** - Based on investigation results
9. **Update Documentation** - Reflect current state
10. **Plan Tomorrow** - Focus on remaining issues

## **KEY FINDINGS**

### **‚úÖ Good News**
- **Issue #100**: Metadata fields already implemented
- **Issue #121**: Column grouping looks good
- **Issue #113**: Counterflow runner ID bug is fixed
- **Issue #122**: F1 anomaly appears resolved (81,423 vs 401,230)

### **üî¥ Critical Issue**
- **CI Workflow**: Version mismatch causing consistent failures
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded version v1.6.18 in app/main.py vs git tag v1.6.19
- **Impact**: Blocking all deployments and releases

### **‚ùì Needs Verification**
- **Issue #115**: E2E auto-copy functionality
- **Issue #91**: Counterflow algorithm relevance

## **SUCCESS METRICS**
- CI workflow running green consistently
- All completed issues properly closed
- Remaining issues properly investigated and resolved
- No workflow violations
- Clean, working system ready for future development

## **NEXT STEPS**
1. Create CI workflow issue immediately
2. Fix version consistency issue
3. Test and verify all claimed completions
4. Close issues that are actually complete
5. Investigate remaining issues thoroughly
